# About Me:

I'm currently a Computer Science student at the [University of Utah]. I've been coding and developing websites, applications, 
and other programs for currently 1-2 years. I'm currently most familiar with: 

- Using Java in an Object-Oriented Fashion
- Using HTMl and CSS, along with some frameworks like Bootstrap and WordPress
- Operating in Eclipse/Android Studio
- Building Simple, Android applications. 

However, over the summer I'm taking classes that will teach me: XHTML, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, and C++. I hope to be able to
use the skills I learn over this summer in my classes to help Online Learning Exchange.
